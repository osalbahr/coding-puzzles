\textbf{Maxsum} \hfill \\
\textit{Course: CSC 246 - Concepts and Facilities of Operating Systems for Computer Scientists} \hfill Fall 2022\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Computed the maximum sum in a subarray of length $\ge$ 1 in an arbitrary length, user-provided array
	\item Compared the time of execution based on the number of processes on arrays of length more than 100,000
	\item Utilized the power of multi-core Central Processing Units (CPUs), bringing down the execution time for an array with 100k elements from 12 seconds to 3 seconds on a dual-core Intel processor
    \item Used a POSIX anonymous pipe as a means for interprocess communication between the parent process and the child processes to fetch and compare results\end{itemize}
\textbf{Wordle} \hfill \\
\textit{Course: CSC 230 - C and Software Tools} \hfill Spring 2022\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Implemented the famous word-guessing game, Wordle, in the C programming language. The user runs the program in a command-line interface (CLI) and provides a file to be used as the word bank
	\item Used merge sort to sort the words in the word bank to enable using binary search, bringing down the time complexity of checking the validity of a guess (i.e. if it exists in the word bank) down to $O(\log{}n)$
